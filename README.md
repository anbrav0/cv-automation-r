# cv-automation-r
This repository is for the purposes of automating my CV for easier use of access and updating. To be able to create your own CV, you will need:

- LaTex (or TinyTex)
- R markdown 


In this repository you will find:

1. The .Rmd file of my CV 
2. PDF File of my CV
3. the LaTex file


This is the `awesomecv` template that was used to create my CV. Most of the information used to create this CV is also in this R-Ladies conference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc1RwRskk08&ab_channel=R-LadiesMelbourne
